# Bouncing-Balls

A simple animation game using the Canvas API

## How to play

- Generate new bouncing balls by clicking the "Generate Balls" button

- Catch a ball by clicking on it with your mouse. This removes it from the screen and ball count.

- The fewer balls that are on the screen when you catch a ball, the more points it will be worth.
